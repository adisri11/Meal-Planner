# App Evaluation
**Expenses Tracker**
- **Mobile**: Essential as the user should have ease of access upon purchasing something or recieving income. The user would also be able to view spending habits quickly to help make financial decisions.
- **Story**: Useful to anyone who wants to track finances, but generally struggle to. Especially useful to those who are just starting off in handling their own finances.
- **Market**: Anyone who makes purchases frequently or wants to understanding their finances.
- **Habit**: Users would constantly use this app daily as many people make purchases everyday. Would definitely be used at least a few times a week.
- **Scope**: Version 1 would have an input section for expenses and incomes. There would also be a table showing the money inflows and outflows. Version 2 would include customizable visuals, as well as a customizable layout. Version 3 would include any sectioning of finances, as well as savings goals.

**Meal Planner**
- **Mobile:** Mobile provides users with easy of use as the grocery list generated would automatically be on their phones. The camera is also essential a it could be used to find recipes based on picuter ingredients.
- **Story:** This app is useful as many people struggle to decide what to make everyday. Through this app they will be able to plan out a few meals, which brings a new variety to their food.
- **Market:** The general public. College students or people who can't figure out what to make on the daily.
- **Habit:** Users would use this once or twice a week to figure out a meal plan for the week and what groceries to buy. They would then use it daily to look at the recipes. 
- **Scope:** Version 1 comes with category buttons. Upon pressing the button, you would be provided a list of recipes from which you would be able to choose from and get the instructions for. Version 2 would include more categories and have the ablitity to include a selection of multiple categories. Version 3 would be where the user selects their categories and gets the list of recipes with similar ingredients, as well as a grocery list. Version 4 includes a list of recipes that the user can choose from, separate from the already curated recipe list in case there are recipes they do not want, as well as being able to add their own recipes. Version 5 implements the ability to take a picture of ingredients and finding a recipe to make. It is likely that the product I will able to finish by the deadline is version 3.
